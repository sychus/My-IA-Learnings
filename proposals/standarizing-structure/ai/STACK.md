# Technology Stack

> **Owner: Dev.** Human-written. Technologies in use and why they were chosen.

## Runtime & Language

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why chosen |
|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| (e.g., Node.js) | 20 LTS | Runtime | (e.g., LTS, ecosystem) |
| (e.g., TypeScript) | 5.x | Language | (e.g., type safety, tooling) |

## Frameworks & Libraries

| Technology | Purpose | Why chosen |
|------------|---------|------------|
| (e.g., React, Express, FastAPI) | (e.g., UI, API) | (rationale) |

## Data & Storage

| Technology | Purpose | Why chosen |
|------------|---------|------------|
| (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) | (e.g., primary DB, cache) | (rationale) |

## Infrastructure & DevOps

| Technology | Purpose | Why chosen |
|------------|---------|------------|
| (e.g., Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions) | (e.g., containers, IaC, CI) | (rationale) |

## Observability

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| (e.g., logging, metrics, tracing) | (e.g., Logs, APM, distributed tracing) |

## Constraints

- Minimum supported versions.
- Deprecation policy (e.g., no new code on deprecated libs).
- Security: how dependencies are updated and scanned.
