# QA skills

> **Owner: QA.** Add here any skills that help agents write tests and follow QA workflows.

Examples:

- When to add unit vs integration vs E2E tests.
- Bug report format and severity definitions.
- Regression test scope and prioritization.
- Test data and fixture conventions.
- How to interpret "flaky" and when to fix or quarantine tests.

Add new `.md` files in this folder; agents will use them when following the bug-fix workflow, writing tests, or triaging known issues.
