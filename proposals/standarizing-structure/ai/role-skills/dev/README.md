# Dev skills

> **Owner: Dev.** Add here any skills that help agents implement and review code correctly.

Examples:

- API design and versioning rules.
- How to structure modules, services, or handlers.
- Database migration and schema change process.
- Logging, error handling, and configuration patterns.
- Tooling (linters, formatters, CI) and how to run them.

Add new `.md` files in this folder; agents will use them when coding, refactoring, or doing code review.
