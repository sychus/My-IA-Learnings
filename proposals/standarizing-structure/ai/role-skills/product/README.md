# Product skills

> **Owner: Product.** Add here any skills that help agents understand what to build and how to interpret specs.

Examples:

- How you write acceptance criteria (format, level of detail).
- Definition of "done" for a feature.
- Priority and scope rules (what goes in MVP vs later).
- How to interpret "out of scope" and when to flag scope creep.

Add new `.md` files in this folder; agents will use them when working on features and specs.
