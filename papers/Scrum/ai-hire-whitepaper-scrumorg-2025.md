# The AI Teammate Framework (Scrum.org Whitepaper, 2025) — Summary

## Reference

- Scrum.org (Sep 2025). **“The AI Teammate Framework: A Four-Step Framework for Product Teams.”**  
  PDF (in this repo): [`AI Hire - Whitepaper.pdf`](./AI%20Hire%20-%20Whitepaper.pdf)

## What this whitepaper argues

Many teams adopt AI through **ad-hoc experimentation**, which can waste money and produce poor outcomes. The paper proposes treating AI as a **new team member** that requires intentional “team management” rather than treating AI as a black box.

## The core model: a 4-step “team management” process for AI

The framework describes AI integration as four steps:

1. **Hiring (selecting the right AI)**: define the role AI will play and choose tools/models based on fit.
2. **Onboarding (providing context)**: give AI the necessary product/team context so its outputs align with goals and standards.
3. **Leveraging (optimizing interactions)**: establish effective interaction patterns (e.g., prompting practices, routing tasks to specialized capabilities).
4. **Managing (evaluating performance)**: continuously evaluate outcomes, compare approaches, and refine how AI is used.

## Key themes and practical takeaways

- **Value + cost awareness**: teams should aim to maximize AI value while being conscious of operational costs (and environmental impact).
- **Empirical mindset**: decisions should be based on what is observed—inspect outcomes regularly and adapt based on learning (mirrors product development empiricism).
- **Clear role definition**: just like hiring, AI usage should start from an explicit job-to-be-done and success criteria.
- **Context portability & “context agents”**: the paper discusses using context-aware agents to keep continuity and route different requests to the best AI capability.
- **Governance and continuous optimization**: standardizing context and evaluation enables evidence-based platform selection and ongoing optimization.
- **Do not disrupt collaboration**: AI should enhance, not replace, established collaborative patterns; avoid dependencies that reduce autonomy and professional development.

## How I’d apply it in a product/Scrum team

- Define a small number of AI “roles” (e.g., research summarizer, backlog refiner, test generator) with explicit success metrics.
- Create lightweight onboarding artifacts (project context, coding standards, product goal, constraints).
- Standardize interaction patterns (prompt templates, review checklists, escalation paths).
- Measure outcomes (time saved, quality, rework, team communication) and iterate on the “AI teammate” setup.
