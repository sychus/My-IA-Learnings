# Introduction

Welcome to **My IA Learnings** — a personal notebook of what I’m learning in AI.

These are notes I’m collecting as I go. They’re not meant to be exhaustive or definitive, and I’ll keep refining them as I read more, build more, and change my mind.

What you’ll find here:

- **Framework notes**: what they are, when to use them, and why (with practical mental models).
- **Protocols & standards**: concepts like MCP and how they fit into tool-augmented AI systems.
- **Skills / playbooks**: reusable workflows that make AI-assisted work more consistent and reliable.
- **Paper summaries**: short, practical writeups focused on the problem, the key idea, and why it matters.

If you’re browsing, start from the main index in the root `README.md` and follow the section links.
